To marinate the steak: In a large baking dish, whisk the cilantro, brown sugar, canola oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, jalapeños, black pepper, and coriander to blend well. Reserve 1/4 cup of the mixture in a small bowl for serving. Place the steak in the remaining marinade and turn to coat. Marinate for at least 20 minutes at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day, turning occasionally. Cover and refrigerate the reserved marinade.                                                                2.

Remove the steak from the marinade (discard the marinade) and grill, turning halfway through cooking, for a total of about 10 minutes, until the meat feels only slightly resilient when pressed with a fingertip for medium-rare. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes.                                                                4. Meanwhile, prepare the tacos: In a large bowl, toss the cabbage, carrots, scallions, and cilantro together.                                                                5. Heat the tortillas on the grill, turning occasionally, for about 1 minute, or until hot. Transfer to a serving bowl and cover to keep warm.                                                                6. To serve: Cut the steak across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Transfer the steak slices and any carving juices to a platter. Serve the steak with the reserved marinade, tortillas, cabbage mixture, and guacamole. Let each guest fill two tortillas with some steak and cabbage mixture and top with some of the marinade and guacamole.

Unless the butcher has already done so, tie the meat around with string at even intervals to hold it together. Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Lay the beef in the pan and fry over a high heat for 5 mins to seal, turning often (step 1). Transfer it to a roasting tin, season with pepper and a pinch of salt, then roast for 17-18 mins (this roasts to medium-rare). Meanwhile, put the porcini in a small heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for 20-30 mins to soak. Pour 1 tbsp of the remaining oil into the same frying pan (don’t wash it) that the meat was cooked in. Tip in the shallots, garlic and chestnut mushrooms and fry for 4-5 mins, stirring often, over a high-ish heat, so all the liquid is first released from the mushrooms then evaporated, and all are softened. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley and tarragon (step 2), season with pepper and a pinch of salt, and leave to cool. Put the mix of leaves in a large heatproof bowl, pour over boiling water, leave for 30 secs, then tip into a colander, rinse under the cold tap and drain. Squeeze out all the moisture with your hands and pat dry with kitchen paper. Chop and set aside. Drain the porcini, reserving 5 tbsp of the soaking liquid. Chop the porcini finely and stir into the mushroom mix. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. When the beef is done, remove from the oven and let it sit in the tin for 10 mins for any juices to be released. Lower the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lift the beef from the tin (keep all the juices in the tin for the gravy) and lay it on kitchen paper. Leave until dry and cool enough to wrap in the filo. Lay 1 of the filo sheets on the work surface with the short end facing you. Brush all over with a little of the remaining oil (you will have 1 tbsp and 1 tsp left). Layer up and oil 4 more filo sheets in the same way. Remove the string from the cooled beef. Spread the chopped leaves down the middle of the pastry, so it is the same length and width as the fillet. Top with the mushroom mix and lightly press down (step 3). Lay the beef over this, with the top of the beef facing down. Bring the long sides of the filo over the beef to enclose it (step 4), then turn it over so the join is underneath. Tuck both ends of the pastry under (trim first if necessary to reduce any excess) and place on the lined baking sheet so all the joins are on the bottom. Brush with more oil. Lay the last sheet of filo on the work surface in front of you, with one of the longest sides towards you, then cut across its width into 5 strips. Lay these one by one, slightly overlapping, over the wrapped beef, scrunching up an edge of each strip slightly as you go to give a bit of height (step 5). Carefully brush with the last of the oil, then bake for 30 mins until golden. If the pastry starts to brown too quickly, loosely lay a piece of foil over the top. Remove the meat and let sit for 5-10 mins before slicing. Meanwhile, make the gravy. Heat the saved roasting juices in the roasting tin, stirring to deglaze. Stir in the flour. Gradually pour in the wine, stirring all the time to blend in the flour. Stir in the stock and reserved porcini liquid and bubble for about 8-10 mins to reduce a little. It should have body, but be thinner like a ‘jus’. Stir in the mustard and season with pepper. Transfer the beef to a platter, then slice thickly with a sharp knife and serve with a spoonful or two of the gravy.</p>","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":220.0,"unit":"Celsius"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Unless the butcher has already done so, tie the meat around with string at even intervals to hold it together.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Sear the beef on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a baking sheet and cool completely, about 20 minutes.                          Add half of the mushrooms to a food processor and pulse until they are very finely chopped. Remove the finely chopped mushrooms to a bowl and continue with the other half of the mushrooms. Reserve.                          Heat the butter and remaining tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Once melted and foaming, add the shallots and sweat until fully softened, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the pan and saute until they release all their moisture and then dry, about 10 minutes. Add the heavy cream and simmer until thick, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs and parsley. Remove the mushrooms to a small bowl, cool completely and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. The mushrooms should now look like a paste.                          Combine the Dijon and horseradish in a small bowl. Once the meat is cool to the touch, snip off the butcher's twine and discard, and then spread the mustard and horseradish mixture all over the beef. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour.                          Adjust a rack to the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.                          Crack the egg into a small bowl and beat until smooth. Dust the work area lightly with flour. Roll out the puff pastry with a rolling pin so it's 4 inches longer than the tenderloin and 6 to 7 inches wider. Brush a 3-inch edge of the pastry with the beaten egg. Spread and pat the mushroom mixture all over the top and sides of the beef. Lay the beef mushroom-side down in the center of the pastry and pat the remaining mushrooms onto the exposed side. Tuck the 2 ends of the pastry into the beef and then fold up the other sides. Place the beef seam-side down on the baking sheet. Brush all over with the egg wash. Cut 3 slits on the top of the roast and sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt.                          Roast until a thermometer inserted into the beef reads 120 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and rest for 20 minutes before slicing into 1-inch-thick pieces. The temperature will rise to 125 degrees F, leaving you with a nice ruby red medium rare.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sprinkle the tenderloin generously on all sides with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat.

Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

course","main dish","dinner"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"InstructionsYou can ask your butcher to prepare the three-pound tenderloin roast for you. That piece is called the chateaubriand. If you are buying a whole tenderloin (about 7 pounds), you will need to remove some silver skin, excess fat, the tail piece, the long strip on the side and the large fatter end, leaving precisely a three-pound piece that will be used for this dish. The scraps can be cut up into steaks or can be used for other purposes. The day before, lay out a long piece of plastic wrap and place the beef on one end and tightly roll up keeping the piece as round as possible. Fold in the plastic ends and repeat with a second, long piece of plastic then finally a third long piece of plastic. Place this in your refrigerator overnight. The purpose of this step is to have the beef formed in as round a shape as possible.Either the day prior, or early in the day of serving, prepare the mushroom Duxelles, the optional liver pate and the wine sauce.MAKE AHEAD: To prepare the mushroom Duxelles, coarsely cut the mushrooms so that they fit in your food processor.Place the mushrooms, shallots, garlic and thyme in your processor and pulse to rice sized pieces.In a large saute pan over medium high, melt butter in the oil and add mushroom mixture along with the salt and pepper and cook for 10-15 minutes. As they cook, they will give up moisture but eventually the moisture evaporates and the mixture becomes thick and pasty. Be careful at this point that it doesnt stick. If you have to, add a little more butter or oil until you achieve the pasty thick consistency and the mushrooms have cooked and the raw smell is gone. The process should take about 10 minutes, maybe a little longer. Set this aside in the refrigerator until needed.MAKE AHEAD: Make the optional pate by melting the butter over medium heat then adding the liver, onion, garlic, salt, pepper and thyme. Cook until the onions are tender and the liver cooked, about 8-10 minutes.Remove from heat and place in a food processor along with Worcestershire sauce and mustard. Puree to a paste and refrigerate until needed.MAKE AHEAD: To make the sauce, in a medium heavy bottomed pot, heat vegetable oil over medium high and once hot, add beef scraps and brown on all sides.Move to edges of pot and add shallots and cook for two minutes then move to edges and add the tomato paste and cook for one minute.Add vinegar and cook just until it evaporates, less than a minute. Scrape the bottom as it dissipates.Add the full bottle of wine along with the thyme sprigs and black pepper. (No salt) Bring to a boil and reduce until all but one cup of liquid is left.Add beef stock, bring to a boil then lower to a slow simmer and simmer for one hour or until the mixture has reduced to approximately 1  cups of liquid.Strain out and discard the solids and pour the liquid back in a glass measuring cup and take a measurement. If it is more than 1  cups, pour into pan and reduce further until it is between 1 and 1  cups of liquid. Remove from heat and stir in the cold butter. The butter will thicken it somewhat. Refrigerate until needed at end of recipe. Note: When reheating the sauce for service, just get it hot enough for serving, do not boil.About 3 hours prior to service, remove the pate and Duxelles from refrigeration to soften.Remove the beef from refrigeration and remove the three layers of plastic. Use five lengths of butchers twine and tie the roast so that it keeps its round shape while searing.Heat a large saute pan over medium high to high heat (larger than the length of the roast). Our roast was 11 and our pan was 12. Add the vegetable oil and once hot, gently add the beef. Sear the beef for one minute per side, rolling the roast 1/8th turn every minute. After the eight-minute cooking time, remove the roast with two pair of tongs to a plate or platter and refrigerate immediately.  Keep refrigerated for at least 30 minutes but do not remove the strings yet.Pull out three sheets of puff pastry dough to thaw. Once thawed, open up and cover with a dish towel.While the beef is chilling, lay out a large piece of plastic wrap.On top of the plastic, lay out the prosciutto slices*(see Notes below) slightly longer than the length of the roast and wide enough so when wrapped around the roast, both sides will touch in the center or overlap slightly. To measure the width properly, I cut one piece of string and wrapped it around the roast to get the circumference and placed the string on top of the prosciutto to get the width correct, then added 2 inches to account for the pate and Duxelles.Using an offset spatula, spread the pate to cover the prosciutto, leaving about a half inch on all sides. Repeat with the Duxelles spreading on top of the pate.Remove the roast from refrigeration and cut off the five strings.Leave it on the platter and smear most of the mustard on the roast, except the bottom. Sprinkle most of the thyme the same way over the mustard.Lift and invert down on the prosciutto, pate and Duxelles, leaving the untreated bottom facing up.  Spread the remaining mustard and thyme over the exposed meat.Carefully lift the edge closest to you by grabbing the plastic and lifting up and over the meat. Gently peel the plastic back. Repeat for the other side the same way. If the two sides overlap, pull one side back down and trim off some of the pate and Duxelles so that the two sides join directly center. I had to spoon off a few tablespoons of the mixture to get the two sides to meet perfectly in the center.Push the whole wrapped roast away from you to make room for the puff pastry dough but leave the roast sitting on the plastic.On a clean surface, lay out two sheets of dough, floured side down. Side by side, they should be wide enough to go well past the ends of the roast. Wet the edge of one piece and slide the other over the edge of the other and press to combine the two into one long sheet.Take the third sheet and cut along the dough folds separating into three. Set one aside and freeze for some other recipe. Take the two remaining pieces to use on the edge closest to you. To do this, wet the big dough along the edge closest two you and place the two small pieces side by side overlapping and sticking to the big piece to finally give you one large piece of dough (also wetting the two small pieces in the center so they stick together). Use a rolling pin and roll out the entire piece slightly to make sure it is large enough to cover the roast.Cut a strip off the left and right of the pastry sheet so the width is about 1  inches longer than the roast on both sides. This gives you room to fold the ends in.Using the plastic under the roast, lift it up and roll out onto the center of the puff pastry, removing and discarding the plastic.Lift the back of the pastry forward pulling up to the center. Before sealing with water, fold the front up to test the length. It should slightly overlap the back piece. If not, trim excess.Wet the top edge then pull the front piece up and over the edge, pressing slightly to seal. (It will go seam down so dont worry about pressing too hard.)Wet and fold each end in like an envelope.Line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Gently lift the roast onto the pan, making sure you turn it so the seam is facing down. Immediately place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.About 15 minutes before the roast comes out of the refrigerator, set oven rack to center with no racks above and preheat oven to 410 degrees F. I know that sounds like an odd temperature but too high and the pastry burns and the roast ends up with a brown outer ring, too low and the roast will not come up to temperature quick enough to cook properly.After 30 minutes, remove the sheet tray from the refrigerator and make at least four slits in the top to let steam escape, then make whatever decorative cuts you wish on top. I dont like making leaves and flowers from the extra pastry dough because they puff up to high and dont look right, but that is just me.Mix the egg and milk and brush over the entire roast, trying not to let it drip onto the paper. If it drips, it burns on the paper and gives off a smell. I know, this sounds really picky but if you are going through the effort to make this, lets go for perfect.Go back over your cuts and steam vents if they filled with egg wash.Mix the salt and sugar and sprinkle over the egg wash.Finally, at last, place in the oven for between 30 and 35 minutes for medium rare. I used a probe thermometer inserted into the end (a must to get this roast perfect) and I removed it from the oven at exactly 120 degrees F, which was 32 minutes.Leave probe in and let the roast sit for at least ten minutes before slicing.While roast is resting, slowly reheat the sauce to serving temperature.Transfer cooked roast to a cutting board using a spatula on each end to lift. Slice into 8-10 thick slices, gently transfer to serving plates with a spatula and drizzle over some wine sauce, or serve on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"You can ask your butcher to prepare the three-pound tenderloin roast for you.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio.

Pat the beef fillet with kitchen paper to dry it of any blood then season with salt and then heavily with black pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan until very hot then spend 8-10 mins searing and turning the fillet with tongs until it’s well browned on all sides. Hold it up to sear both ends as well. Set the beef aside on a tray to catch any juices and turn the heat off the pan but don’t clean it. Drain and squeeze out the dried porcini but reserve the juice and tip the porcini into a food processor with the other mushrooms and thyme. Season everything with salt and pepper and pulse until finely chopped but not completely smooth. Place the beef pan back on the heat with the butter and when it starts to sizzle add the shallot and cook for 2 mins until softened. Turn the heat up and tip in the mushrooms, add a splash of Worcestershire sauce and cook everything for 10-12 mins until you have a paste that comes away from the side of the pan. Tip into a bowl to cool, stir through the parmesan if using and set aside. Turn off the heat from the pan but don’t clean it.  The beef can be seared and the mushroom mixture can be made several hours in advance. For the first stage of assembly get a large sheet of cling film and overlap the prosciutto slices on it in a row, tip the mushroom mix on top then cover with another sheet of cling film. Either with your hands or  a rolling pin, pat it down or roll it out to a thin layer that just covers the prosciutto. Remove the top sheet of cling film and sit the fillet down the centre of the mushrooms.

For the best results now place the sausage in the freezer for 30 mins to firm up – do not leave for longer of cooking times will be affected.On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry to a rectangle a little larger than a magazine, trim the edges to neaten and save the trimmings. Lightly brush the pastry all over with beaten egg. Carefully unwrap the prosciutto parcel and lay in the middle of the pastry. Like wrapping a parcel or making a spring roll fold the shorter edges over the fillet then roll the whole thing around the fillet to encase. For a really neat finish get another clean sheet of cling film and roll the Wellington into a sausage tight sausage again. Place in the fridge and chill for at least 30 mins or up to a day. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 with a sturdy, lightly oiled baking tray in it. Re-roll the pastry trimmings and use to make 6 leaves. Unwrap the Wellington, brush all over with egg then decorate with the leaves. Brush the leaves with more egg. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and transfer, sealed side down to the heated baking tray. Bake the for 10 mins then reduce the heat of the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and continue to bake for 25 mins for rare meat, 30 mins for medium rare, 35 mins for medium and about 45 mins for well-done, making sure the pastry doesn’t burn (you can cover it with foil if it starts to become too dark. Remove from the oven and leave for 10 mins to relax.To make the gravy, heat the butter in the mushroom pan and fry the shallot, thyme and bay, scraping the crispy bits of the pan with a wooden spoon. Scatter over the flour and brown then splash in the brandy, sizzle for a minute, then add the red wine and boil to a purple paste. Pour in the mushroom soaking liquid, avoiding the gritty bits at the bottom, crumble in the stock cube and any juice from the resting beef and simmer for 5 mins until you have a tasty gravy, season to taste.

Set the meat on top of the vegetables and add water to just cover the meat. Bring to a boil skimming any foam that surfaces.

          Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until very hot, and brown the meat in 2 batches, stirring to brown the cubes on all sides. Return all the meat to the Dutch oven, sprinkle with flour, and stir lightly to coat the meat with flour. Stir in onion, carrots, dark beer, bay leaves, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil, and cover.                            Place the Dutch oven into the preheated oven, and cook for 45 minutes; uncover, stir the stew, and cook until the beef is very tender and the liquid is reduced by half, about 45 more minutes.                            Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble the bacon and set aside.                            About 30 minutes before the stew is ready, make the colcannon: Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.                            Place the cabbage into a microwave-safe bowl, and add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water. Cover and microwave on High for about 2 1/2 minutes; uncover (watch out for steam) and stir the cabbage. Cover and microwave for about 2 1/2 more minutes, until the cabbage is slightly tender but not mushy. Drain excess liquid, and set the cabbage aside, covered.                            Place the potatoes into a large bowl, and add milk, butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Beat the potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir in the cabbage, crumbled bacon, and parsley until well combined.                            To serve, place a scoop of colcannon onto a plate, make a hollow, and fill with braised beef stew.

oven for 45 minutes or until fork tender. Set aside to cool, remove the skins, and transfer to a large bowl. (Alternately, you can peel and chop the potatoes and sweet potato and boil until fork tender.) Mash with the coconut milk and salt and pepper. Whip the potatoes with an electric beater, adding more milk as necessary, until light and fluffy. Set aside.Meanwhile, soak the sun-dried tomatoes in hot water for 30 minutes. Separately, soak the dried mushrooms in 1 cup of hot water for 30 minutes. Drain the sun-dried tomatoes, chop, and set aside. Drain the mushrooms and reserve the soaking water.Rinse the lentils and transfer to a medium saucepan and add 2 cups of water, the turmeric and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the lentils are soft and the water is mostly evaporated. Add more water during the cooking process if necessary.Meanwhile prepare the sauce. Heat the oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. When hot, add the shallots or onion and saut for 4 to 5 minutes until soft. Stir in the chilies and flour and cook for another few minutes, stirring constantly. Add the dried and fresh mushrooms to the pan, along with the coconut milk, reserved mushroom soaking liquid, water, spices and salt. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until thickened  about 15 minutes. Stir in the fenugreek leaves and simmer for another few minutes.Now make the pie. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. When hot, add the onion to the pan and saut until soften - about 5 minutes. Stir in the carrots and parsnip and cook for another 8 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Add the ground spices and chilies to the pan, stir for a minute, and then add the red wine, stock or water to deglaze. Stir until the liquid has evaporated. Add the tomatoes to the pan and simmer for another few minutes. Add the spinach a few handfuls at a time until wilted. If using peas, stir them in now and simmer for another few minutes, stirring often. Stir in the lentils and simmer for another few minutes until thickened but not dry. Season with some salt and pepper.Transfer the vegetable and lentil mixture to a lightly greased casserole dish. Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over top. Bake in a 400 oven for 20 to 30 minutes until the top begins to brown. Place under the broiler for a few minutes to further brown the potatoes. Let stand for 10 minutes.Serve hot or warm with a ladle or two of mushroom sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pierce the potatoes and sweet potato with a fork and bake in a 425 oven for 45 minutes or until fork tender.

In a large bowl, combine the liver, pork fat, pork shoulder, pepper, allspice, garlic, shallots, cognac, white wine, and parsley and cover. Refrigerate overnight. That was easy.2. The next day, remove the mixture from the refrigerator, add the salt, and pass everything through the strong meat grinder, which you have fitted with a medium blade. The grind size should not be too small (paste) nor too large (chunks). Basically, you’re looking for a grind size about that of meat loaf. If you don’t have a durable meat grinder, suck up to your friendly neighborhood butcher and take your mix down to him. He should like you by now; he doesn’t get a lot of calls for pork liver and pork fat. (If that’s also not an option, trim off as much sinew as possible, cut the pork into small dice, and hope for the best.)3. When your meat and other ingredients are ground up, add the egg and mix through by hand. Preheat the oven to 325°F (170°C).4. Line the terrine mold with one big piece of caul fat (or overlapping pieces, if you must) so that plenty of extra flops over the edge — enough to cover the top of the pâté when you fill the mold. Fill the terrine with the ground mixture, packing it tightly. Lift the terrine and firmly drop it onto the work surface (easy, don’t go nuts) a few times, to knock out any air pockets. Fold over the remaining caul fat to neatly cover the pâté, trimming and tucking until it looks nice. Now cover the whole megillah with foil.5. Set up a bain-marie inside the preheated oven. Put the filled terrine in the center. Obviously, you do not want the water level to be so high that the water leaks into the terrine mold. You want just enough water so that it comes up below the rim. Cook the terrine in the water bath in the oven for about 2 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature is 160°F (70°C) (this is where your meat thermometer comes in).6. When done, remove from the oven and allow to cool. Place a weight on top of the terrine (still in foil) and refrigerate overnight. The next day, remove the weight, remove the foil, melt down the duck fat in a small saucepan, and pour it carefully over the pate. Then refrigerate again for a few hours. The pâté will keep in the refrigerator for at least 5 days.7. Serve with cornichons and maybe a tiny salad. If you did everything right, the pâté, when sliced, should be firm and moist, not dry or crumbly. The color should be uniform, not pink at the bottom and gray on the top. It should be cooked through, and the slices should have structural integrity, meaning they don’t break when you cut them.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, combine the liver, pork fat, pork shoulder, pepper, allspice, garlic, shallots, cognac, white wine, and parsley and cover.

Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, roll the dough out and place it in a 9-inch tart pan or (deep dish) pie plate. fillingHeat a skillet over low heat and add the butter. Stir in the shallots and cook until caramelized, stirring often, about 25 minutes or so. Be sure to stir frequently since shallots are thinner than regular onions! Once caramely and golden, stir in the garlic and turn off the heat.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the broccoli on the sheet, spread out. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until just starting to char. When the broccolini is finished, reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees F. Chop the broccolini once it has cooled a bit.While the broccolini is roasting, add the bacon to a large skillet over medium heat. Cook until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crispy, then remove the bacon with a slotted spoon. Place it on a paper towel to drain any excess grease. To the same skillet, add the potatoes. Cook until the potatoes are slightly crisp but tender when poked with a fork. Remove the potatoes and place them in a bowl. Whisk together the eggs, cream, cheese, salt and pepper. Place half of the potatoes, bacon, brocc and shallots into the crust and pour the egg mixture over top. Add the remaining potatoes, bacon, broc and shallots, mixing them in gently. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until golden on top and set in the center. Slice and serve with sriracha!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"crust","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor and pulse just until combined.

|Yield: About 6 to 8 servingsIngredientsFor the Meatballs:1/2 pound of ground beef1/2 pound of Italian sausage, removed from the casings1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs2 large eggs1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder2 teaspoons of dried parsley1/4 cup of grated ParmesanKosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to tasteFor the Gravy:1 tablespoon of olive oil1 cup of chopped onion1/2 cup of chopped green bell pepper1/4 cup of chopped celery4 cloves of garlic, minced1-1/2 pounds of Italian sausage1 (28 ounce) can of whole tomatoes1 (15 ounce) can of diced or stewed tomatoes2 teaspoons of Italian seasoningKosher salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the Ziti:1 pound of ziti pasta1 cup of ricotta cheese1 large mozzarella ball, or about 4 cups shredded divided1 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese, dividedInstructionsFor the meatballs, combine ingredients and form into tiny meatballs, about the size of a cherry tomato. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F oven for 10 minutes; set aside.Meanwhile, for the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, green pepper and celery. Cook until softened but not brown, add the garlic and cook another minute. Remove the sausage from the casings and add to skillet, breaking up the meat to fine crumbles. Cook over medium to medium high heat until lightly browned; drain off any excess fat. Using kitchen shears, roughly chop the tomatoes in the can, and add those along with the Italian seasoning to the skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and let cook for about 30 minutes. Remove 2 cups of the sauce for layering and set aside.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and generously salt. Cook the pasta just to al dente according to package directions; drain. Once the ziti has stopped steaming, add it to the remaining sauce and combine well. Taste, add salt and pepper, and adjust seasoning as needed.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large oblong 4 quart baking dish, add half of the ziti mixture. Dollop the ricotta on top of the pasta and top with slices of fresh mozzarella, or use shredded. Reserve one cup or enough slices of the mozzarella for the top. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese evenly over the top of that. Add half of the meatballs. Dot top with 1 cup of the reserved tomato sauce mixture and smear it around. Add the remaining ziti mixture and top with the remaining meatballs and the remaining sauce. Add another layer of mozzarella, reserving some for later, and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese evenly over the top of that.Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and place a baking sheet on the rack below as insurance for any spillover. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50 to 60 minutes or until bubbly. Uncover, sprinkle the top with the remaining mozzarella cheese and return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes, or until casserole is bubbly, cheese has melted and center is hot.Cook's Notes: Substitute your favorite homemade or commercial spaghetti sauce for this dish. You'll want about 4 to 5 cups of sauce. May also be made with the meat sauce only and omit the meatballs.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South Dish","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Recipe: Southernized","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Baked Ziti","ingredients":[{"id":11520420,"name":"ziti","image":"ziti.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"From the Kitchen of Deep South Dish","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Prep time: 40 min |Cook time: 1 hour 10 min |","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":50,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"creditsText":"Deep South Dish"}{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":13,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":true,"whole30":false,"sourceUrl":"http://kitchenconfidante.com/white-pizza-bianca-with-zucchini-recipe","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/pizza-bianca-with-zucchini-497064","aggregateLikes":1006,"spoonacularScore":87.0,"healthScore":20.0,"creditText":"Kitchen Confidante","sourceName":"Kitchen Confidante","pricePerServing":190.5,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":10211821,"aisle":"Produce","image":"yellow-bell-pepper.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"bell pepper","original":"freshly ground black pepper","originalString":"freshly ground black pepper","originalName":"freshly ground black pepper","amount":4.0,"unit":"servings","meta":["black","freshly ground"],"metaInformation":["black","freshly ground"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings"},"metric":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings"}}},{"id":1020,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"fontina.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"fontina cheese","original":"4 oz fontina cheese, sliced","originalString":"4 oz fontina cheese, sliced","originalName":"fontina cheese, sliced","amount":4.0,"unit":"oz","meta":["sliced"],"metaInformation":["sliced"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces"},"metric":{"amount":113.398,"unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams"}}},{"id":11215,"aisle":"Produce","image":"garlic.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"garlic","original":"4 cloves garlic, finely minced","originalString":"4 cloves garlic, finely minced","originalName":"garlic, finely minced","amount":4.0,"unit":"cloves","meta":["finely minced"],"metaInformation":["finely minced"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves"},"metric":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"cloves","unitLong":"cloves"}}},{"id":1082047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"salt.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"kosher salt","original":"kosher salt","originalString":"kosher salt","originalName":"kosher salt","amount":4.0,"unit":"servings","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings"},"metric":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings"}}},{"id":1026,"aisle":"Cheese","image":"mozzarella.png","consitency":"solid","name":"mozzarella cheese","original":"6 oz mozzarella cheese, sliced","originalString":"6 oz mozzarella cheese, sliced","originalName":"mozzarella cheese, sliced","amount":6.0,"unit":"oz","meta":["sliced"],"metaInformation":["sliced"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":6.0,"unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces"},"metric":{"amount":170.097,"unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams"}}},{"id":4053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"olive-oil.jpg","consitency":"liquid","name":"olive oil","original":"olive oil for brushing","originalString":"olive oil for brushing","originalName":"olive oil for brushing","amount":4.0,"unit":"servings","meta":["for brushing"],"metaInformation":["for brushing"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings"},"metric":{"amount":4.0,"unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings"}}},{"id":11477,"aisle":"Produce","image":"zucchini.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"zucchinis","original":"1-2 zucchinis, thinly sliced","originalString":"1-2 zucchinis, thinly sliced","originalName":"zucchinis, thinly sliced","amount":1.0,"unit":"","meta":["thinly sliced"],"metaInformation":["thinly sliced"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}}],"id":497064,"title":"Pizza Bianca {with Zucchini}","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":4,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/497064-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["mediterranean","european","italian"],"dishTypes":["lunch","main course","main dish","dinner"],"diets":["gluten free","lacto ovo vegetarian","primal","ketogenic"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 450°F.

Make a well with walls that are about 1 inch thick, make sure the well is large enough to hold the eggs, milk and oil. Add the yolks, egg, milk and oil. Break the yolks. Using your fingers, stir quickly. The motion will allow the liquid to pick up flour from the walls and will gradually become thicker. This will take about 10 minutes. As the liquid becomes thicker, close to a paste consistency, start to push the flour walls up over and into the liquid pool. Continue to stir until the flour and liquid is mostly incorporated. Pull the dough into a ball, it will be shaggy and seem a bit dry. Knead on a flat surface with the heel of your hand, this will take a ten to fifteen minutes. Knead until the dough is smooth and slightly elastic. If you aren’t sure if the dough is done, keep kneading. This isn’t a dough that can be over worked, but too little kneading is a problem. Put dough into a small bowl and cover tightly and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cut into 4 sections. Place any dough sections you are not working with back in the bowl and cover. One at a time, roll out the dough sections to about ¼ to ½ inch rectangle. Attach the KitchenAid Pasta Roller attachment to your stand mixer. Set the thickness to 1 (the thickest setting). Turn the KitchenAid stand mixer to a speed of 2. Feed the dough rectangle into the pasta roller narrowest side first.Pass through two or three times. Narrow the thickness to a 3. Pass the dough sheet through two or three times, this should get easier and easier with each pass. Narrow the thickness to a 5. Pass the dough sheet through two or three times, this should get easier and easier with each pass. You want the dough sheets to be so thin you can see through them. Lay the sheets on a flat surface.Place about 2-3 tsp of goat cheese on the dough sheets about 1 ½ inches apart, in to rows. Brush the dough with water around the balls of goat cheese (sprinkle with fresh herbs, if desired). Top with second sheet of pasta. Press the pasta around the filling, sealing well. Use a sharp knife or a pastry wheel to cut into squares. Place on a plate, allow to sit for about 10 minutes. Cook in a pot of lightly salted boiling water until raviolis float and are cooked through. Drain, plate and top with sauce. Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet over medium high heat, cook the onions until soft about five minutes. Add the tomatoes, cook until soft and the skin has blistered. Add the garlic, cook for about 30 seconds. Add the beer and cook until the beer has mostly evaporated, about ten minutes. Add the remaining basil, oregano, salt and pepper, stir, remove from heat. Add to a food processor along with the tomato paste, process until smooth.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"On a flat surface add the flour.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Char all sides of the 2 poblano chilis over a gas burner, a bbq ...or broil in an oven.

What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.82,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.7673684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fchehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009%2F109305"}]},"instructions":"Heat

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Crumble ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat.

A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Big, ripe and dense, this is a brooding wine with rich ripe tannins and great aging potential. Among red varieties Syrah reigns supreme in its ability to produce great wine from both warm and cold sites. The warm locales give us intensely colored wines that are overt and voluptuous. The cooler sites produce exotically scented bottlings of structure and elegance.

Pat the brisket dry with paper twoels and prick the roast all over with a fork. Cut the brisket in half crosswise into two roasts (just like you'd cut a sandwich or apple in half). Season each roast with salt and pepper.In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium or medium-high heat until rippling and hot. Brown the brisket on both sides (working with one roast at a time), about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer fat-side up to a 9X13-inch baking dish. Repeat with the remaining roast.Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from the skillet. Add the mushrooms and 1/8 teaspoon salt and cook over medium heat until the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms are golden brown, about 6-8 minutes. Add the onions and sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8-10 minutes. Add the flour, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring constantly, until golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the broths and bay leaves, scraping up any browned bits. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until thickened, about 6-7 minutes.Pour the sauce over the roasts in the 9X13-inch pan and cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake the roasts in the preheated oven until very tender, 4 1/2 to 5 hours. Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool, covered, for 30 minutes to 1 hour, flipping the roasts and recovering the dish halfway through cooling.Transfer the roasts to a cutting board and trim any extra fat off, if the roasts are excessively fatty. Strain the sauce from the pan through a fine mesh strainer into a fat separator; reserving the mushrooms. Let the liquid settle and then pour into a microwave-safe bowl, leaving the fat behind. Stir in the vinegar and microwave the sauce for about a minute. If the sauce is too thick, thin with chicken or beef broth. Slice or shred the brisket roasts and place on a serving platter with the reserved mushrooms. Pour the warmed sauce over the meat.

well with Shiraz, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel.

It is known for producing outstanding rich reds with a classic spicy finish. Shiraz has long been recognised for growing particularly well in the warmer and drier regions such as those of South Australia and Mudgee in New South Wales. In these environments, it achieves a richness of varietal character and depth of concentration that best suits our Diamond Label style.The grapes for this wine were sourced predominantly from our vineyards in South Australias McLaren Vale and Langhorne Creek, with a proportion from Mudgee in New South Wales and also Murray River Valley. In McLaren Vale, the long generous summers generally are tempered by cooling breezes from the Gulf of St. Vincent and Lake Alexandrina, whilst the night time cool of the Blue Mountains produces similar conditions in Mudgee. These cool periods enable the colour pigments and natural acidity within the fruit to stabilise, thus allowing the typically full, spicy flavours of the variety to ripen whilst retaining overall structural balance.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435537-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.7375,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frosemount-diamond-shiraz-2003%2F77672"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Individually selected lots were kept separate during initial fermentation in order to highlight their vineyard differences and extract the quintessence of their specific strengths. The resulting blend is a soft and elegant wine that highlights the delicious and powerful ripe fruit flavors that characterize the world-class grapes of the Napa Valley.Cuvée M exhibits a graceful stream of very fine bubbles gently rising to a persistent mousse cordon with a light peach rose color. The aromas are elegant, rich and complex, showing fresh white and yellow stone fruits with subtle hints of wild strawberry. A light touch of fresh brioche, with hints of vanilla and honey add to the wine's complex bouquet. On the palate, full flavors of peach and pear combine with a creamy caramel character, which lingers into a long satisfying finish.Mumm Napa's Cuvée M is the perfect sparkling wine for champagne cocktails or as an apéritif to pair with hors d'oeuvres.

A blend of approximately half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir this crystal bright, light-bodied Champagne is elegant and distinctive. Opening with aromas of fresh pineapple, lemon and white florals, warming into complex scents of pear. A rich bouquet of white fruits end in subtle notes of honey and vanilla. The bead is intense with brisk effervescence, swirling up into a generous and persistent mousse. It is a balanced, extremely refined wine that, if properly stored, should keep for years, especially if bottled in magnums or jeroboams.Beyond the toasts and ship launchings, Champagne has a place at every dinner table. The 1996 Fleur de Champagne pairs is the perfect wine to serve with smoked oysters, game hens, delicate Japanese fish dishes, Fettuccini Alfredo or risotto. After a patient search for a master glassmaker capable of reproducing a bottle with the 1902 Gallé design, Perrier Jouët launched in 1969, its famous \"flower bottle\" with an arabesque design of anemones. The first bottles of Fleur de Champagne revealed a Champagne of vivacious delicacy, the epitome of the refined and engaging style of the Art Nouveau movement. Since then, it has been the signature Champagne of Perrier Jouët and is considered one of the world's most celebrated Champagnes.","price":"$129.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433586-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.8273684210526318,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fperrier-jouet-belle-epoque-1996%2F7383"}]},"instructions":"Combine all ingredients in small bowl.

The aromas are elegant, rich and complex, showing fresh white and yellow stone fruits with subtle hints of wild strawberry. A light touch of fresh brioche, with hints of vanilla and honey add to the wine's complex bouquet. On the palate, full flavors of peach and pear combine with a creamy caramel character, which lingers into a long satisfying finish.Mumm Napa's Cuvée M is the perfect sparkling wine for champagne cocktails or as an apéritif to pair with hors d'oeuvres.

salt and pepper to taste in a medium bowl. Whisk together until mixed well. Add the chicken pieces to the bowl and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for about 1 hour or overnight.To prepare the tzatziki sauce pour any liquid off the surface of the greek yogurt. (I find it is best to use full fat greek yogurt for this, but 2% works ok as well. You want the yogurt to be thick, so if your greek yogurt seems thin strain it through a fine mesh strainer.) Mix together the greek yogurt, diced cucumber, garlic, white wine vinegar, dill, oregano, salt and pepper to taste, and lemon juice. Drizzle with olive oil. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.If making the tapenade, dice the olives and mix in a small bowl with the garlic, pepperoncini and parsley. Set asideTo cook the chicken preheat your broiler. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Place the chicken on a baking pan and broil the chicken for 5-7 minutes until cooked through. Pour the remaining marinade in a medium size skillet and bring to a boil.

Sprinkle the chops generously with salt.                          Set up a standard breading procedure: In 3 large dishes, set up one with the flour, one with 2 eggs beaten with 2 tablespoons water and one with the breadcrumbs.                          Dust each chop in the flour and shake off the excess. Dip each chop in the egg mixture and then run through the breadcrumbs. Place the breaded veal on a sheet tray and let them hang out in the fridge for at least 1 hour to allow the breading to set.                          Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.                          Add enough oil to coat a large saute pan until it is a depth of 1/4-inch. Add 2 tablespoons butter and bring the pan to a medium heat. Working in batches, fry the veal chops until they are golden brown on both sides, about 6 minutes total. Drain each chop on paper towels and salt each one as they come out of the oil. After the second chop, change out the oil and butter and fry the 2 remaining chops. Reserve the cooked chops in the warm oven.                          Coat a nonstick saute pan lightly with oil and fry the remaining 4 eggs sunny side up. The whites should be cooked and the yolks should be warm and runny, cook for 4 to 5 minutes.

Add (optional) habanero powder for additional \"heat.\" Reduce burner to medium and cover to cook veggies until tender, about 10 minutes, stirring half way through. Meanwhile, make a slurry with cornstarch and orange juice.Uncover, stir and squeeze in lime juice. Add chicken. Slowly add orange juice slurry and cook until sauce is thick, adding chicken broth to thin it out if needed.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maso Canali Pinot Grigio with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.
