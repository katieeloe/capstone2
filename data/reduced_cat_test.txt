Leave the tentacles whole.2 This recipe was designed for a deep-fryer, but you can also fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot (keep a lid nearby, for safety reasons) halfway with oil, about 3 inches deep.  Heat the oil to 360-370째F. 3 While the oil is heating, mix all the dry ingredients together well.4 Once the oil has reached 360째F, take the sparkling water out of the refrigerator and mix it with the egg yolk. Immediately mix it in with the dry ingredients. Mix quickly. Do not worry if there are clumps or lumps. Over-mixing may cause the batter to become chewy when cooked.5 Working in small batches at a time (about 8 pieces), dip the squid pieces in the batter. Pick them up one by one and gently put them in the hot oil. (Note if your fingers are coated with the batter, it will help protect them from splatter.) When the squid pieces are in the oil, use a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon to dislodge any squid pieces that may have become stuck from the bottom of the pot or fryer. Fry for 45 seconds to 1 minute, and remove to paper towels to drain.  Note that when done, they will NOT be golden brown, but more of a pale yellow or tan.  Repeat with the rest of the squid. Working in batches will help keep the oil temperature from falling too far while you are frying the squid.Serve immediately with lime or lemon wedges, soy sauce, ponzu sauce, Tabasco or another hot sauce.Once the cooking oil has completely cooled (after about 2 hours), strain it through a paper towel-lined sieve, and save it to reuse the next time you want to deep fry seafood.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1 Slice the squid tubes into rings about 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch wide.

Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine\'s complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine\'s luscious

Whisk the cola, cilantro, soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar pepper and garlic in a large baking dish. Add the pork and turn to coat. Cover the baking dish and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours.                          Prepare the grill for indirect grilling, with part of the grill at high heat. Remove the pork from the marinade 30 minutes before grilling to take the chill off.                          Grill the pork until charred, about 3 minutes. Flip the pork and grill for another 3 minutes. Both sides of the pork should be nicely charred. Move the pork to indirect heat, cover the grill, and cook for about 5 minutes until a meat thermometer inserted in the pork registers 150 degrees F. Remove the pork from the grill and set aside, loosely tended with foil, about 10 minutes.                          Cut the pork, against the grain, into thin strips. Fill the lettuce leaves with some of the pork, a drizzle of the Gojuchang Sauce and top with the Quick Kimchi.                          Put the cabbage in a large bowl. Make an ice bath in a larger bowl.                          Combine the vinegar, fish sauce, gochujang, honey, ginger, garlic and chiles in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer and immediately pour over the cabbage. Set the bowl of cabbage in the ice bath and cool, tossing occasionally. When the cabbage is cool, add the cilantro and onions.

Transfer them to a work surface and using the side of a heavy knife, coarsely crack the peppercorns; transfer to a large, deep bowl. Add the kosher salt and the brown sugar, then add the serrano chiles, garlic and one-third of the jalapeos. Stir in the warm water until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Add the pork and enough cold water to submerge the roast. Cover and refrigerate overnight.                                              Preheat the oven to 400. Drain the pork and pat dry, then transfer to a roasting pan. Let the pork return to room temperature. Roast the pork for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, turning once; the pork is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 165. Let rest for 30 minutes before slicing thinly.                                              Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the white vinegar, granulated sugar and table salt and stir until dissolved. Add the carrots and let stand until softened, about 30 minutes.

Pour into a spice grinder and process until powdered. In a small food processor or blender, combine the toasted spice mix and the rest of the wet masala ingredients. Process until smooth.                          Place a large (preferably nonstick) pot over high heat and add the oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the onions and serrano pepper. Stirring frequently, saute the onions until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Don\'t let them burn! Turn the heat down to medium-high if they\'re starting to burn.                          Add the ground wet masala, taking care because it will sizzle wildly and steam up your glasses, if you wear them. Stir quite vigorously and turn down the heat if it\'s bubbling too furiously. Don\'t wash the food processor bowl yet. Keep stirring, with short pauses, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the masala comes together as one mass, about 2 minutes. Also, you may see little droplets of oil on the perimeter of the masala. That\'s a good sign!                          Quickly add the meat and stir, coating the meat in the masala. Stir and cook about 5 minutes until the meat browns.                          Remember that dirty food processor bowl? Fill it with 1 cup of hot water (from the tap is fine), swirl it around so it picks up any leftover masala, and pour that into the pot. Add salt and pepper, stir, bring the curry to a boil, and then turn it down to a simmer. Cover and cook 30 minutes. Then cook with the lid ajar for another 10 minutes to thicken the gravy slightly. Check the meat at the end of the cooking time; it should be tender and not chewy at all. Adjust the salt if you like, and serve over rice or with chapatis (whole wheat griddle bread).                          Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste.                          Save what you don\'t use in a small glass jar.

2.In a casserole dish, brown the shanks in a little oil until golden. Season lightly and cover with the stock. Add a bay leaf and place in the oven for three or 3 hours until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. Allow the shanks to cool in the liquid.                3.While the shanks braise, make the mash. Cover the potatoes with warm water in a large pot and cook on a low heat for 30 minutes - the water should remain just under a simmer, which helps set the starch.                4.Drain the potatoes. Bring fresh water to the boil with three teaspoons of salt. Add the potatoes and cook at a simmer until they are just falling apart. Drain well and quickly dry any excess water.                5.Mash the potato (a food mill or potato ricer is best, but never blend, which will split the starch) on to the cubed butter in a bowl, stir through until amalgamated. Add the warm milk in batches until you have a smooth, creamy consistency - you might not need all the milk; just don\'t make it too wet. Season with salt, stir through the mustard and set aside.                6.In a wide-based heavy pot, add a little oil and cook the onion, carrot, celery, garlic and star anise for 10 minutes, stirring. Add chopped porcini and tomato paste and cook for a further five minutes. Add the wine and reduce to a syrup. Remove the star anise and discard. Set the vegetables aside.                7.Pull the shank meat from the bone and roughly dice. Set aside.                8.Add the porcini liquid to the shank liquid and reduce by three-quarters over a high heat. Reduce to the lowest heat, and throw in the rosemary and mint to infuse for 15 minutes. Discard the herbs.                9.In a large frying pan over high heat, bring some oil to smoking point and fry the mince until well browned. Add to the shank meat.                10.Preheat the oven to 180 degrees fan-forced or 200 degrees conventional.                11.Take a little of the reduced stock, add the cornflour and stir to combine. Add back to the rest of the stock and stir to thicken. Pour this into the vegetables and wine, mix well, then add the meat and the peas and season well. Mix gently, trying not to break up the shank meat - the mix should be luscious but not too wet.                12.Tip the filling into a high-sided ovenproof dish. Cover evenly with the mash (it is best if the pie sits below the top of the dish to stop it leaking). Make a ridged pattern in the mash with a fork and bake for 20-30 minutes or until bubbling.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat a fan-forced oven to 160C or 180C conventional.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":160.0,"unit":"Celsius"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"In a casserole dish, brown the shanks in a little oil until golden.

                                                     For the Basic Pasta Dough: Put the flour, eggs, and egg yolks in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed until the dough comes together. Turn off the mixer, remove the paddle attachment, and replace it with the dough hook. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat the dough with the dough hook on medium speed until it forms a ball, about 5 minutes. Dust a flat work surface with flour. Turn the dough out onto the dusted surface and gently knead it for 20 to 25 minutes, until the ball begins to feel elastic and the surface of the dough feels smooth and silky. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate to rest for at least 45 minutes and up to overnight before sheeting it (any longer and the dough will discolor).                                                                                                                            2                                                                            To make the Ravioli: Combine the ricotta and Parmigiano-Reggiano in a medium bowl, and sprinkle with the salt, sugar, and nutmeg. Stir to combine the seasonings with the cheese. Stir in the cream, adding more if necessary to obtain the consistency of soft- serve ice cream. (You can make the filling up to two days in advance. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble the ravioli.) Scoop up 1/3 cup of the ricotta filling and form it into a disk about 1/2 inch high and 2 1/4 inches in diameter. Set the disk on a plate and repeat, forming the remaining ricotta into a total of 8 disks. Set them aside while you prepare the dough for the ravioli.\xa0                                                                                                                            3                                                                            To make the ravioli, cut eight 4-inch square pieces of parchment and dust two baking sheets with semolina. Roll the dough out to the third thinnest setting on a pasta sheeter (number 6 using a KitchenAid attachment), stacking the sheets of dough on one of the parchment-lined baking sheets. When you have rolled out all of the dough, dust a flat work surface with flour and lay one sheet of the\xa0dough on the floured surface. Place three or four ricotta disks on the dough, leaving 4 inches between each disk and 1 1/2 to 2 inches of dough on all the sides of the outer disks. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to make a crater deep enough to hold an egg yolk in the center of each disk. Separate one egg, reserving the white and carefully sliding the yolk into one crater. Repeat, filling the remaining 2 or 3 disks in the same way (you don’t need to reserve any more whites).                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Lay a second sheet of dough directly behind the first and use a rolling pastry cutter, starting at the edge of the dough nearest your body and moving in a straight line directly away from you, making one long cut through both sheets of dough between two disks of ricotta. Continue making cuts down the sheet of dough between the disks. Using a pastry brush, brush egg white around each cheese disk. Lift one segment of dough from the back sheet and lay it on top of the corresponding front segment of dough. Without lifting the raviolo, cup both hands around the cheese so that the edges of your pinky fingers press down around the cheese, sealing the raviolo closed. Repeat, covering and sealing the remaining ravioli. Use a 3 × 3 inch fluted cookie cutter or fluted pastry wheel to cut each raviolo, discarding the scraps of dough around it. Place the ravioli on the prepared baking sheet and repeat, assembling the remaining ravioli in the same way. Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to boil them, or for up to 8 hours.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Fill two wide pots with 6 quarts of water each. Add 6 tablespoons of salt to each pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Have a slotted spatula or slotted spoon and a clean dishtowel handy for lifting the ravioli out of the water.\xa0                                                                                                                            6                                                                            While the water is coming to a boil, make the brown butter sauce. Place the butter and sage leaves in a medium saucepan and cook over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes without stirring, swirling the pan occasionally to brown the butter evenly and prevent it from burning, until the bubbles subside and the butter is dark brown with a nutty, toasty smell. Reduce the heat to low to keep the butter warm while you cook the pasta.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Remove the ravioli from the refrigerator and, one at a time, lift the parchment holding each raviolo off the baking sheet and gently drop the raviolo with the paper into the water, adding 4 ravioli to each pot. (The parchment will quickly separate and will be easy to remove from the water.) When you have dropped all the ravioli, remove and discard the parchment paper, partially cover the pots to return the water to a boil quickly, and keep it boiling. Cook the ravioli for 4 minutes. With a clean dishtowel in one hand and a slotted spoon or spatula in the other, lift one raviolo out of the water and onto the dishtowel to blot it dry, and then carefully place it in the center of a dinner plate.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Repeat with the remaining ravioli.

Add onion; saut until golden, 5 minutes. Stir in celery and carrot; cook 5 more minutes. Add sausage and 1/2 tsp. salt, breaking up meat with a spoon, and cook until it loses its raw color.                                                                                                 Add milk and cook over medium heat, stirring, until completely evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes. (The mixture will appear quite curdled at this point.) Add wine and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and juice, bring to a boil, lower heat, and gently simmer, uncovered. Cook rag until liquid reduces by a third, about 30 minutes. Season with 1/4 tsp. pepper and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt.

Preheat oven to 375. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions; don\'t overcook. Drain noodles and lay flat on kitchen towels without overlapping. Oil a 9- by 13-in. baking dish and spread with about 1/2 cup rag. Add a single layer of noodles (for most brands this is 3 sheets per layer). Spread with a third of ragu, then top with another layer of noodles, half the cheese mixture, and another layer of noodles. Repeat layering, giving you 2 alternating layers of sauce and cheese. Cover with remaining third of rag and sprinkle evenly with remaining parmesan.

Heat the olive oil into a large skillet or dutch oven over medium heat. Saute your onions and garlic for 5 minutes then add your chicken broth, cornmeal, chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Transfer this mixture plus diced or crushed tomatoes to a high powered blender. Blend until smooth. Transfer sauce to a large bowl and stir in 1/4 cup greek yogurt. Spoon about 1/2 cup sauce into the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish. Set aside.Heat remaining olive oil into a large dutch oven over medium heat. Saute your leeks or onions, chopped asparagus and zucchini for about 5 minutes. Add your cooked chicken pieces. Spoon chicken and vegetables into the center of each warm tortilla. Roll and place seam side down into your baking dish. Continue filling and rolling until pan is filled. I used about 12 per pan.

To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe.

Add the chorizo and cook until lightly browned; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Add the onions, peppers and garlic to the pan and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stir to combine, then stir in the rice and saffron. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 minutes. Pour in 5 cups of the simmering chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Immediately remove the pan from the heat and season with salt.

Scatter the peas over the paella, return to the oven and continue cooking until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender but not too soft, another 5 to 10 minutes. If the rice needs further cooking, add the remaining cup of stock and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.                          Let the paella stand at room temperature, covered with foil, for 5 minutes.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high to high heat. Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan. Season the chops with paprika, salt, and pepper. Place chops in skillet and sear meat to caramelize, about 2 minutes each side. Transfer the chops to a cookie sheet and place in the oven to finish off, 8 to 10 minutes, or until meat is firm to touch, but not tough. Remove from the oven and let the chops rest covered with a piece of aluminum foil for a few minutes.                          While the chops are in the oven, return the skillet to the cook top over medium heat. Add the diced chorizo and cook stirring frequently for 2 minutes. Add the garlic, onion, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook meat and onions for about 3 minutes.                          Bring 1 to 2 inches of water to a boil in another skillet with a lid.                          Grind the peppers and parsley in a food processor until smooth. Add the sherry or wine to the sausage and onions and stir, then stir in the ground peppers. Cook another minute or 2 or until the peppers are heated through.                          Place green beans in boiling water. Salt it and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and dress with a squeeze of lemon, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and salt and pepper.                          Place a chop on each dinner plate and top with the chorizo-roasted pepper sauce. Serve with green beans, garnished with Marcona or toasted almonds, Cheesy Rice and/or crusty bread, for plate-mopping.                          Melt butter over medium heat in a medium sauce pot.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio.

Mix the oregano and paprika with some salt and pepper in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture all over the pieces of chicken; marinate for 30 minutes so the flavor can sink in a bit.                          Heat the olive oil in a paella pan or wide shallow skillet over medium-high heat. Place the chicken in the pan, skin-side down and brown on all sides, turning with tongs. Add the chorizo and continue to cook until the oil is a vibrant red color. Remove the chicken and sausage to a platter lined with paper towels.                          Return the pan to the stove and lower the heat to medium. Make a sofrito by sauteing the garlic, onion, and tomatoes; cook until the mixture caramelizes a bit and the flavors meld; season with salt and pepper. Fold in the rice, stirring to coat the grains. Stir the saffron into the rice. Pour in the water and simmer for 10 minutes, gently moving the pan around so the rice cooks evenly and absorbs the liquid. Do not cover or constantly stir like risotto.                          Add the shrimp, lobster, clams, the reserved chicken, and the chorizo. Give the paella a couple of good stirs to tuck in all the pieces and just let it simmer, without stirring, until the rice is al dente, about 15 minutes. Scatter the peas on top and continue to cook for 5 minutes, until the paella looks fluffy and moist. The ideal paella has a toasted rice bottom called socarrat. Allow to rest, off the heat for 5 minutes, and garnish with parsley. Serve with lemon wedges.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Rinse the chicken pieces and pat them dry.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix the oregano and paprika with some salt and pepper in a small bowl.

                 Preheat oven to 400F. Place onions, potatoes, carrot, fennel, and garlic in a heavy roasting pan. Toss with olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. In a small bowl, combine coffee, cinnamon, cardamom, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Rub all over brisket and nestle brisket into vegetables to rest on bottom of pan. Roast until vegetables are lightly browned, 45 minutes.

As the brisket cooks, check on it every 45 minutes, adding 1/4 cup water to the pan if it starts to look dry. When the brisket is cooked, remove roasting pan from oven, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate with the vegetables until fat is solid, 8 to 24 hours. Transfer brisket to a cutting board and slice across the grain. Skim and discard fat in the roasting pan. Return brisket slices to the roasting pan with the vegetables and cooking juices.                                                                To serve, preheat oven to 300F. Transfer roasting pan to oven and heat brisket until liquid is melted and brisket and vegetables are just warmed through, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the brisket and vegetables to a serving dish, cover with foil, and reserve. Set the roasting pan over two burners on the stovetop and simmer the liquid over medium heat until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.

Season the brisket generously with salt and pepper. In a very large enameled cast-iron casserole, heat 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil. Add the brisket and cook over moderately high heat, turning, until browned all over, about 12 minutes. Using tongs, carefully transfer the brisket to a rimmed baking sheet, fat side up.                                              Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat from the casserole. Add the onions and half of the garlic and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the carrots, parsnips and celery and cook over moderate heat until browned in spots, about 6 minutes.                                              Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the prepared horseradish with the remaining garlic and 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Spread the garlic-horseradish paste on the fat side of the brisket.                                              Pour the red wine into the casserole. Bring to a boil and cook over high heat, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the casserole, 1 minute. Push the vegetables to the side of the casserole and add the bay leaves. Set the brisket, horseradish side up, in the center of the casserole. Pour the beef stock around the brisket and bring to a simmer over moderate heat. Cover the casserole, transfer to the oven and cook for 1 hour.                                              Scatter the potatoes around the brisket, cover and cook for about 2 hours longer, until the meat is very tender. Increase the oven temperature to 350. Uncover the casserole and roast for about 30 minutes, until the brisket is browned on top and the gravy has thickened.                                              Carefully transfer the brisket to a carving board and let rest for 30 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.

Pour the brisket cooking liquid into a fat separator and let stand until the fat rises to the surface. Pour the cooking liquid into a gravy boat and discard the fat.

What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon\'s cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

A blend of approximately half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir this crystal bright, light-bodied Champagne is elegant and distinctive. Opening with aromas of fresh pineapple, lemon and white florals, warming into complex scents of pear. A rich bouquet of white fruits end in subtle notes of honey and vanilla. The bead is intense with brisk effervescence, swirling up into a generous and persistent mousse. It is a balanced, extremely refined wine that, if properly stored, should keep for years, especially if bottled in magnums or jeroboams.Beyond the toasts and ship launchings, Champagne has a place at every dinner table. The 1996 Fleur de Champagne pairs is the perfect wine to serve with smoked oysters, game hens, delicate Japanese fish dishes, Fettuccini Alfredo or risotto. After a patient search for a master glassmaker capable of reproducing a bottle with the 1902 Gallé design, Perrier Jouët launched in 1969, its famous \\"flower bottle\\" with an arabesque design of anemones. The first bottles of Fleur de Champagne revealed a Champagne of vivacious delicacy, the epitome of the refined and engaging style of the Art Nouveau movement. Since then, it has been the signature Champagne of Perrier Jouët and is considered one of the world\'s most celebrated Champagnes.","price":"$129.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433586-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.8273684210526318,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fperrier-jouet-belle-epoque-1996%2F7383"}]},"instructions":"Add oil to a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high eat.

The resulting blend is a soft and elegant wine that highlights the delicious and powerful ripe fruit flavors that characterize the world-class grapes of the Napa Valley.Cuvée M exhibits a graceful stream of very fine bubbles gently rising to a persistent mousse cordon with a light peach rose color. The aromas are elegant, rich and complex, showing fresh white and yellow stone fruits with subtle hints of wild strawberry. A light touch of fresh brioche, with hints of vanilla and honey add to the wine\'s complex bouquet. On the palate, full flavors of peach and pear combine with a creamy caramel character, which lingers into a long satisfying finish.Mumm Napa\'s Cuvée M is the perfect sparkling wine for champagne cocktails or as an apéritif to pair with hors d\'oeuvres.

A blend of approximately half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir this crystal bright, light-bodied Champagne is elegant and distinctive. Opening with aromas of fresh pineapple, lemon and white florals, warming into complex scents of pear. A rich bouquet of white fruits end in subtle notes of honey and vanilla. The bead is intense with brisk effervescence, swirling up into a generous and persistent mousse. It is a balanced, extremely refined wine that, if properly stored, should keep for years, especially if bottled in magnums or jeroboams.Beyond the toasts and ship launchings, Champagne has a place at every dinner table. The 1996 Fleur de Champagne pairs is the perfect wine to serve with smoked oysters, game hens, delicate Japanese fish dishes, Fettuccini Alfredo or risotto. After a patient search for a master glassmaker capable of reproducing a bottle with the 1902 Gallé design, Perrier Jouët launched in 1969, its famous \\"flower bottle\\" with an arabesque design of anemones. The first bottles of Fleur de Champagne revealed a Champagne of vivacious delicacy, the epitome of the refined and engaging style of the Art Nouveau movement. Since then, it has been the signature Champagne of Perrier Jouët and is considered one of the world\'s most celebrated Champagnes.","price":"$129.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433586-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.8273684210526318,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fperrier-jouet-belle-epoque-1996%2F7383"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a food processor, finely chop olives and artichokes.

These flavors and aromas have disappeared over the years but now Mionetto are reintroducing them in this excellent cuvée.A delicate pale yellow color, with a characteristic aroma that blends with hints of honey and crab apples. It is dry and pleasantly slightly bitter on the palate.

A blend of approximately half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir this crystal bright, light-bodied Champagne is elegant and distinctive. Opening with aromas of fresh pineapple, lemon and white florals, warming into complex scents of pear. A rich bouquet of white fruits end in subtle notes of honey and vanilla. The bead is intense with brisk effervescence, swirling up into a generous and persistent mousse. It is a balanced, extremely refined wine that, if properly stored, should keep for years, especially if bottled in magnums or jeroboams.Beyond the toasts and ship launchings, Champagne has a place at every dinner table. The 1996 Fleur de Champagne pairs is the perfect wine to serve with smoked oysters, game hens, delicate Japanese fish dishes, Fettuccini Alfredo or risotto. After a patient search for a master glassmaker capable of reproducing a bottle with the 1902 Gallé design, Perrier Jouët launched in 1969, its famous \\"flower bottle\\" with an arabesque design of anemones. The first bottles of Fleur de Champagne revealed a Champagne of vivacious delicacy, the epitome of the refined and engaging style of the Art Nouveau movement.

Bring to a boil then remove from burner and let sit.Melt 4 TBS of the butter in a large skillet or saute pan and add celery, onion, garlic and apple. Cook for 5-8 minutes on medium high until everything has softened slightly. Add the sausage, breaking it up with your hands. Stir the sausage in and cook for 5 minutes. Then add the mushrooms, sage and the cranberries in their liquid. Cook another 5-10 minutes until sausage is browned. Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove sausage mixture from the heat and let cool. (This is a great time to butterfly your turkey breast if you haven\'t already).When sausage mixture has cooled slightly, mix in bread crumbs, parmesan, eggs, ½ cup of the stock, salt and pepper.Preheat oven to 375 degrees.Spread one butterflied turkey breast half on a cutting board. Spread 1-1½ cups of stuffing on top of the turkey leaving a half inch border on all sides (stuffing should not be more than ½ inch thick or it will be hard to roll the turkey).Starting at one end, roll the turkey up, poking any stuffing that comes out back in, until you have a nice cylinder or turkey. Use some twine to tie the cylinder every two inches to help it stay together. Repeat with the second turkey breast. You can roast both turkey breasts for 12 servings or freeze one for later.Place the turkey on a rack in a roasting pan and pour 1 cup of turkey stock into the pan. Cover the pan with foil and roast in the oven for 50 minutes.After 25 minutes scoop the leftover stuffing into a small casserole dish and put it in the oven.When the turkey has cooked 50 minutes, melt the remaining two tablespoons of butter then remove the foil and brush the butter all over the turkey. Place back in the oven (uncovered) for another 25 minutes.After the last 25 minutes, use a digital thermometer to check the internal temperature in a few places, it should be at least 150 degrees. Remove the turkey and casserole dish of stuffing and cover them both with foil. Let rest for 15 minutes.Remove the foil and use a pair of scissors to remove the twine. Slice the turkey into six 1½ to 2 inch rounds. Serve with extra stuffing.

Add onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.Add the breadcrumbs and then the water to the bowl of your electric mixer. Be sure all the bread crumbs are moistened.Add the ground beef, cream, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and allspice. Mix on high speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes using a 325-watt mixer, up to 10 minutes for lower-powered mixers.Preheat a large skillet with 4 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Once butter melts and the skillet is nice and hot, scoop up tablespoons of meat mixture and remove it with another tablespoon, shaping them into balls, as best you can. Place them into the melted butter and brown on all sides and thoroughly cooked, 8 - minutes. (Do not overcrowd the pan. Overcrowding reduces browning and thebrowning provides flavor to dishes.) Repeat until all meatballs are fried. Transfer the meatballs to a warm oven (170F, if possible).Once the meatballs are all cooked, add the rice flour to the butter left in the skillet and stir immediately. (Cold broth is best as it prevents lumping.)Add broth and stir. You can add additional flour if you desire a thicker sauce. However, if you plan on allowing the gravy to sit for any period of time, it will become thicker. Season with salt or pepper.Add the meatballs to the gravy and gently toss. Serve with egg noodles, mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, or rice and your favorite vegetable or salad.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small skillet.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Remove from heat and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the breadcrumbs and then the water to the bowl of your electric mixer.

After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Black River Winery Merlot with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430352,"title":"Black River Winery Merlot","description":null,"price":"$10.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/430352-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":2.0,"score":0.7171428571428571,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2009-Black-River-Winery-Merlot/dp/B00ED59310?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.
